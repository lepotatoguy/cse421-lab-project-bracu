## What have we done:


### Router Config:
* We have configured the routers and DHCP Server according to the user limit given in the question. (In Router Config Command)
* We have connected the routers with each other
* We have configured the routers to connect with server
* We have configured the PC ip-config accordingly
* Created the Index.html for the web server and setup the web server. (Initially it worked but after some time, pinging was successful but it wasn't showing in web browser)

### IP Route Completed to:
* Ralph Bohner to Library (and vice versa)
* Ralph Bohner to M & B (and vice versa)
* Ralph Bohner to Proctor Residence (and vice versa)
* M & B to Proctor Residence (and vice versa)
* M & B to Library (and vice versa)
* Proctor Residence to Library (and vice versa)

We didn't do the rest as we have shown some of the ip routes getting successfull.

### How we setup the router physically: 

PC to Switch - Copper StraightThrough - Fast Ethernet (Yellow) to Fast Ethernet (Yellow) Port

Switch to Router - Copper StraightThrough - Fast Ethernet (Yellow) to Fast Ethernet (Yellow) Port

Router to Router - Serial DCE (with watch logo) - will be Connected through Serial Port. - need to take serial port inside the router

PC to Router (to config) - blue wire - RS232 to Console

Server to Switch - Copper StraightThrough - Fast Ethernet (Yellow) to Fast Ethernet (Yellow) Port

NVRam stores all the data permanently.


Switch - CFE 4pcs and FFE 2pcs

Router - FFE 2pcs, 1S 2pcs, CFE 2pcs

## This project consists of:
* PKT File
* Question
* Network topology diagram with proper labels 
* The configuration commands of all the routers that you have implemented. 
* VLSM tree
* IP address table
